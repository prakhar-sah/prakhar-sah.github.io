### Running locally with Docker

To test locally with docker, run the following in your terminal after installing docker into your system:

1. `docker image build -t resume-template .`
2. `docker run --rm --name resume-template -p 4000:4000 resume-template`

### Customizing

First you'll want to fork the repo to your own account. Then clone it locally and customize, or use the GitHub web editor to customize.

#### Options/configuration

Most of the basic customization will take place in the `/_config.yml` file.

#### Editing content

Most of the content configuration will take place in the `/_layouts/resume.html` file. Simply edit the markup there accordingly.
