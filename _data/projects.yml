# Ripencapsulation
- project: Interrupt-based side-channel attacks against commercial TEEs
  role: Main Contributor
  duration: 2022 &mdash; 2024
  # url: "#"
  description: "Texas Instruments MSP IP Encapsulation (IPE) aims to provide confidentiality
                of data stored inside the IP-encapsulated memory zone; this includes proprietary
                code and keys. I devised exploits breaks this guarantee by leveraging two fundamental
                drawbacks in MSP430 IPE design: residual state on context switches and lack of call site
                verification. I exploit these flaws to create an interrupt-based side channel to gain
                cycle-accurate control IPE execution and exfiltrate all IPE secrets. The evaluation shows
                that these attacks work against most-widely used production tools and settings of popular
                open-source cryptographic implementations."

# Springfield Community Outreach Group
- project: A survey of secure checkpointing techniques in energy-harvesting devices
  role: Main Contributor
  duration: 2022 &mdash; 2023
  # url: "#"
  description: "I survey state-of-the-art works catering to the security of checkpointing techniques in
               energy-harvesting devices. I find that the protection schemes fall under one of the two categories:
               crypto- graphic or PC-based memory isolation. My comparative study of the adopted threat models 
               reveals that most of the secure checkpointing techniques do not consider an adversary with physical 
               access which is a common occurrence in real-world IoT deployments. To design a reliable intermittent
               computing defense, one must consider a real-world adversarial model that is practical for both vendors
               and software providers in terms of deployment, flexibility, and energy consciousness."
